Really Simple Featured Video plugin provides a really straightforward way of adding featured video support to your custom post types. Adding your own videos to the site is a breeze and you get an easy to use settings panel with the options you really need.

With Really Simple Featured Video you get a metabox at posts, pages & products edit screen at the very bottom and a very similar interface as you're used to with featured image.

You get a really simple settings page which has all the controls you need for managing featured videos throughout your site. Explore it yourself for a better look or take a look at screenshots below.

#### *NEW* Youtube, Dailymotion and Vimeo Support

You can now embed videos from Youtube, Dailymotion and Vimeo directly at each post/page/product or any custom type that supports featured images.

#### WooCommerce Single and Shop Archives Support

This plugin came out of a real need with many plugins available out there yet none provides a good integration with WooCommerce.
Really Simple Featured Video plugin provides a straightforward implementation for WooCommerce Product Featured Video, with which your set featured video loads directly into product thumbnails along with any other product images.

#### Supports for Core themes

We now support all the major newer core themes such as TwentyTwenty Four to Classic themes.

#### Enable/Disable Post Types Support

You can enable/disable support for post types via the settings page though by default featured videos are enabled for blog posts.

#### Enable Video Autoplay

You can also enable autoplay for featured videos, this is an option available at settings page.

#### Shortcodes

There are also shortcodes to embed featured video at any post, page or product you want.

`[rsfv]` shortcode is for displaying set featured video of the individual post anywhere in the post.

`[rsfv by_postid]` shortcode is for displaying featured video of any post anywhere you want, you just need to pass a vaild post id to it e.g. `[rsfv_by_postid post_id="281"]`
