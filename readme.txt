#### WooCommerce Support

This plugin came out of a real need with many plugins available out there yet none provides a good integration with WooCommerce.
Really Simple Featured Video plugin provides a straightforward implementation for WooCommerce Product Featured Video, with which your set featured video loads directly into product thumbnails along with any other product images.

#### Enable/Disable Post Types Support

You can enable/disable support for post types via the settings page though by default featured videos are enabled for blog posts.

#### Enable/Disable Video Controls, Autoplay, Loop & Picture-In-Picture

You can manage everything for the featured videos, by setting them accordingly, options for these are available at settings page.

#### Mute Video Sound

You also have an option to control video sound, set this at the settings page.

#### Shortcodes

There are also shortcodes to embed featured video at any post, page or product you want.

[rsfv] shortcode is for displaying set featured video of the individual post anywhere in the post.

[rsfv_by_postid] shortcode is for displaying featured video of any post anywhere you want, you just need to pass a vaild post id to it e.g. [rsfv_by_postid post_id="281"]
